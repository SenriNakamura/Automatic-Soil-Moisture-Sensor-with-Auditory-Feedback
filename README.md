## Introduction
In this final project for EE14 Embedded Systems, Senri Nakamura and Brian Kim aimed to innovate traditional soil moisture detection by developing a system utilizing a capacitive moisture sensor integrated circuit interfaced with the STM32L4 Cortex-M4 microcontroller. Designed for real-time, accurate monitoring of soil moisture levels, this system provides essential information for agriculture, gardening, and environmental monitoring applications. Our unique approach incorporated auditory feedback to convey soil moisture status, facilitating use in various lighting conditions and breaking barriers for individuals with visual impairments.

## Background and Functionality
Effective moisture management is crucial for the vitality of crops and the sustainability of environmental ecosystems. While existing solutions typically rely on visual or digital displays, our project seeks to convey soil moisture levels through auditory feedback. This method aims to enhance usability for individuals with visual impairments and in scenarios where visual monitoring is impractical. Moreover, this sensor could be implemented in automated vertical farming.

We plan to simulate soil moisture conditions, translating them into auditory signals generated by the STM32L4 microcontroller. This application of the capacitive moisture sensor allows for a robust, corrosion-resistant system capable of providing immediate and intuitive feedback about soil conditions through changes in sound frequency, pitch, or volume.

## Technical Approach/Framework

### Core Components
- STM32L4 Cortex-M4 Microcontroller
- Capacitive Moisture Sensor
- Speaker for auditory feedback via audio jack from STM32L4

### Functionality
- **Capacitive Moisture Sensor Simulation**: The sensor simulates variable soil moisture conditions by generating signals that mimic the analog output you'd expect from a traditional soil moisture sensor. Analog outputs of the sensor is converted to digital inputs to be read by the microcontroller.
- **STM32L4 Interface**: The microcontroller reads the sensor's output, interpreting these signals to determine simulated moisture levels.
- **Auditory Feedback**: The STM32L4 activates the speaker to emit sounds that correspond to the detected moisture level, with unique tones indicating dry, moist, or wet soil conditions.

## Tasks and Subtasks

### Hardware Setup
- Integrate the capacitive moisture sensor with the STM32L4, ensuring accurate signal generation that corresponds to varying moisture levels.
